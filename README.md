# Go Make Dinner

This is a toy project that I'm building out as a way to learn go. 

## Running the code

```bash
go run ./src/main.go
```


## Scripts

I recommend [pyenv](https://realpython.com/intro-to-pyenv/)

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Create a json for a recipe using just the title
python ./scripts/create-recipe.py ./assets/prompts/create-recipe.md -o ./assets/data/recipes/lunch/ "Protein-Rich Pumpkin Muffins"

# Convert all of the .webp files to jpg, skipping ones that are already converted
python ./scripts/webp-to-jpg.py ./assets/images/raw -o ./assets/images/jpgs
```

## AI Prompts

The `assets/data/prompts/` directory has some AI prompts that I'm using to generate the recipe JSON and images for that recipe. There is some sample data in the assets folder. Most of it has been generated by `chatgpt-4o` so far.
