# Go Make Dinner

This is a toy project that I'm building out as a way to learn go. 

```bash
go run ./src/main.go
```


Scripts
```bash
python ./scripts/create-recipe.py ./assets/prompts/create-recipe.md -o ./assets/data/recipes/lunch/ "Protein-Rich Pumpkin Muffins"
```

The `assets/data/prompts/` directory has some AI prompts that I'm using to generate the recipe JSON and images for that recipe. There is some sample data in the assets folder. Most of it has been generated by `chatgpt-4o` so far.
